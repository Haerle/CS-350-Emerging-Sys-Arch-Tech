# CS-350-Emerging-Sys-Arch-Tech



During this project I feel that I did a lot of things well. I felt that my structure was good, my comments in the code helped a lot. I need to improve on everything still though. I feel more comfortable with my programming abilities now than I was coming into this course. I still have a lot of work to do though. I used zybooks, github for resources. I had a lot of questions during this course but I was able to find the answers by looking through the zybook readings and threads in github. The skills that will be transferable from this course would be would be the structure development and my programming.
